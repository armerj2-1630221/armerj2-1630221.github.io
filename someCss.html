	<p1> As you may already know, I am a diehard Pittsburgh Steelers fan. As a result, I hate Tom Brady because the Patriots beat us every single year.</p>
	<p2> I do also love the Pittsburgh Penguins. Sidney Crosby is definitely my favorite hockey player because he has persevered through a lot of hardship throughout his career.</p2>
