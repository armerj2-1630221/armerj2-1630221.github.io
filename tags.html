	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>My name is Jason Armer, and I attend University of Washington and am currently a Sophmore studying business. My favorite part about the University of Washington is being in the Husky Marching Band. Being in the band has opened me up to a ton of opportunities in my life, and I've met a ton of cool people as a result!</p>
	<p>My favorite hobbies right now are playing basketball at the IMA and watching sports on TV. I'm a diehard Mariners fan, and I also love the Pittsburgh Steelers (yeah I know, they beat the Seahawks in the Super Bowl, don't be bitter.)</p>
